This directory is a Unity Project with .gitignore ignoring the common files for the Unity FREE Version

- If you want to contribute clone the repo, modify and ask for a pull request

- If you just want to use it, you can take the file Package/TwisterAndNormalize.unitypackage .

I started playing with the Unity framework and I came out with this first small library that may be is useful for someone else.

I ported into Unity the Mersenne-Twister pseudorandom number generator and a function to convert the random sets of data in a Normal Distribution.

Still "work in progress" but I want to post the code to see if anyone is interested in help me with critics and suggestions.


The unity package contains:

Scripts

- UnityMersenneTwister.cs: Mersenne Twister Pseudo Random generator
- UnityNormalDistribution.cs: Functions to convert the random number using a normal cdf

Editor/Scripts

- MersenneDebugWindow.cs : This script create a window to test the random numbers and the normalization, and to write a random numbers to a file (for further analysis with a statistics package)
- MersenneDebugDrawing.cs : This script is used to draw a simple scatterplot of the random generated data

In syntesis: we generate normal distributed random numbers that can be useful in some applications inside a game (AI beaviour, terrain generation, etc....). If you need a Gaussian noise, may be this package is for you!
